This is my personal blog and portfolio website built with Jekyll, a static site generator. The site serves as a technical blog covering web and mobile development with a focus on Ruby on Rails, while also showcasing case studies of various projects. The site is hosted on GitHub Pages and has been reskinned and improved several times over the last 15 years while retaining a full history of posts and pages.

- **Jekyll** - Static site generator
- **Liquid** - Templating language
- **Pygments** - Code highlighting

**Frontend:**

- **CSS3** with custom styling and Pico CSS framework (current iteration)
- **HTML5** with semantic markup

**Development Tools:**

- **Docker** - Containerization for development environment
- **Make** - Build automation
- **Git** - Version control
- **GitHub Pages** - Hosting platform

**Key Dependencies:**

- **jekyll-paginate** - Blog pagination
- **jekyll-gist** - GitHub Gist integration
- **jekyll-mentions** - Social media mentions
- **jekyll-redirect-from** - URL redirection
