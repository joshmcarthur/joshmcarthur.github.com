      Josh works with a range of technolgies, but focusses on Ruby on Rails, Ember.js and
      Chef as daily drivers (these being back-end, front-end and server management tools respectively).
      He is firmly in the Android camp, and as such enjoys tinkering with native and hybrid (Cordova) development,
      and will natter on about the latest Android news to anyone who will listen.

      Based on Wellington, New Zealand, Josh enjoys making the most of this great city, and is
      passionate about the outdoors, craft beer, and cats.
