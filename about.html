<h1>About Me</h1>

<h2>Who I Am</h2>

<p>
  Hi! My name's Josh McArthur. I'm a fairly young guy and I
  seem to be passionate about keeping up to date with the latest
  in the <em>web development</em> world. I try my best with <em>web design</em>,
  but I really am far more comfortable in a text editor and terminal
  than Photoshop. I'm currently employed by a local web consultancy here in Wellington named <a href="http://rabid.co.nz">Rabid Technologies</a>, as a developer.
  Outside of work I enjoy dabbling in obscure corners of the
  technical world, socializing and exploring Wellington and the surrounding area.
</p>


<h2>What I Do</h2>

<p>
  I'm a lifelong learner, so in terms of what I'm doing <em>right now</em> -
  well it could be anything. Here's a break down of what I'll be doing in a
  typical day though:

  <ul>
    <li>
      Using <a href="http://google.com/apps">Google Apps</a> throughout
      the day for managing emails, meetings and documents.
    </li>

    <li>
      Working on between two and four <a href="http://rubyonrails.org">Rails</a> applications throughout
      the day - some Rails 2.3, and some Rails 3-3.x.
    </li>

    <li>
      Using handy services like <a href="http://memcached.org">memcached</a>, <a href="http://redis.io">Redis</a>
      <a href="http://www.postgresql.org/">PostgreSQL</a> to manage in the applications I build.
    </li>

    <li>
      Working in my development environment - VIM on OS X, occasionally
      taking a break to spin up a VM and reminicsing about the good ol' days
      when I used to use <a href="http://ubuntu.com">Ubuntu</a> (this was before Unity came along).
      I'll also occasionally do a tad of brower testing in Windows XP or Windows 7 as well.
    </li>

    <li>
      Setting up servers to host Rails applications securely, usually
      on <a href="http://rimuhosting.com">Rimuhosting</a>, or taking the cloud-based
      all-round shortcut, <a href="http://heroku.com">Heroku</a>.
    </li>

    <li>
      Finishing work and heading home for nights full of hacking <a href="https://github.com/joshmcarthur">a range</a>
      of projects together using <a href="http://sinatrarb.com">Sinatra</a>, Ruby on Rails, or
      <a href="http://expressjs.com">Express.js</a>/<a href="http://nodejs.org">Node.js</a>. I've also
      done a couple of things using this new <a href="http://meteorjs.com">Meteor</a> thing, and I
      expect I'll be using that a lot more in the future.
    </li>

    <li>
      Open-sourcing all the work I do on <a href="https://github.com/joshmcarthur">Github</a>, contributing
      to other open-source projects, writing
      blog posts and helpful <a href="http://twitter.com/sudojosh">tweets</a>. I also love
      helping people with web development in person, and generally
      trying to be helpful.
    </li>
  </ul>

  ... whew!
</p>

<h2>What I Believe In</h2>

<p>
  I open source <em>everything</em>. A lot of the stuff I put out there, as far as I know,
  is not used by anybody, and that's cool. It's enough for me to know
  that someday, maybe someone will get some help from something I've created.
</p>

<p>
  Giving back to things that are useful to me - this might be
  particular causes or campaigns, tools, code, people, projects - whatever,
  as long as they've given me an equivalent value in a time saving, or
  lesson learned. For more information about how I give back,
  check out my <a href="/donations">record of projects I've donated towards</a>.
</p>

<p>
  Putting in the effort to achieve something is something you'll have to do
  to earn my respect. I've worked hard to get to where I am, and continue to do so.
  I absolutely believe that unless you are 100% dedicated to your goals, or at the
  very least, some sort of short-term objective, you're never going to make
  much progress in any direction.
</p>

<h2>Where I Live</h2>

<p>
I live in <a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?q=Wellington,+New+Zealand&hl=en&sll=37.0625,-95.677068&sspn=42.03917,61.875&oq=Wellington,+New+Ze&t=h&hnear=Wellington,+New+Zealand&z=10">Wellington, New Zealand</a>.
It's a great city - free WiFi in the CBD, widely known to have the best coffee in New Zealand (if you know where to look),
and above all, a real hub of innovation and growth.
