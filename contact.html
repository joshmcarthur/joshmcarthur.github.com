<p>
  If you'd like to get in contact with me, I recommend
  you use one of the services on the right. Here's some things
  I might be interested in:

  <ul>
    <li>Short-term or casual contract-based work</li>
    <li>Helping out with a problem if you're a fellow coder</li>
    <li>Working on an open-source project</li>
    <li>Advice on anything to do with Rails, Node.js or any other web technology</li>
  </ul>
</p>

<p>
  If you do want to contact me, please understand that I do
  keep myself fairly busy, so I may not reply straight away.
</p></div></div>
