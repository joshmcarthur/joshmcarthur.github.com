<h1>Contacting Me</h1>

<p>
  If you'd like to get in contact with me, I recommend
  you use one of the services on the right. Here's some things
  I might be interested in:

  <ul>
    <li>Short-term or casual contract-based work</li>
    <li>Helping out with a problem if you're a fellow coder</li>
    <li>Working on an open-source project</li>
    <li>Advice on anything to do with Rails, Node.js or any other web technology</li>
  </ul>
</p>

<p>
  If you do want to contact me, please understand that I do
  keep myself fairly busy, so I may not reply straight away.
</p>

<p>
  <strong>
    Please note it is my personal policy to not reply to
    any recruiter or recruitment agency, any discourteous or unclear
    email, or to any requests for my time (for free), to work on non-open-source projects.
  </strong>
</p>
