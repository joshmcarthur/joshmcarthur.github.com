I tried to get to Eastern Hutt Hut on Friday. Didn’t quite make it, just because I’d committed to a half day rather than full day trip, but it seemed doable. I turned around [here](https://www.topomap.co.nz/NZTopoMap?v=2&ll=-41.037834,175.221848&z=15) with 2km to go, it took me 2 hours to get there after biking over from Kaitoke on the 4WD road - 1 hour biking, just over 1 hour walk/running. It felt like another 1-1.5 hours to the hut in the riverbed or game trails. Definitely no track, so it’s a case of bush bashing or rock hopping in the river.

Easter Hutt Hut is for emergency use only, since it’s in or near the water catchment area - visitors are asked to clear the area in a day, rather than staying.
