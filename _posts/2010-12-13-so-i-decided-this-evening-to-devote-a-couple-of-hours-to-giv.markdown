So I decided this evening to devote a couple of hours to giving back to Spree,
after using the framework for a couple of work projects, and appreciating it
for it's flexibility and extensibility.Â 
I've developed an extension for Spree called Import Products. The source is
based on a few bits of code that I have used for 2 projects now to import
products into a Spree store from a comma-seperated values file (.CSV).
It's not perfect, but I'm happy with it as my first ever full contribution back
to the Ruby on Rails community - I hope I have done a good enough job that it
is useful to a couple of people.
If you want to check out the source code, it's on github.
If you want to check out a description of the extension, check out the Spree
extension_page.
