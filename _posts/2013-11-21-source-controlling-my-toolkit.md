This morning, I created a new repository on Github called [toolkit](https://github.com/joshmcarthur/toolkit). I'm using it to keep track of the tools I use every day, in order to benefit others who are interested in how I work, and for my own benefit, to be able to easily refer to documentation, source code and links for tools that may be useful for a particular situation.

I've tried to do this type of thing many times in the past - sometimes by writing a blog post, or forking or 'starring' a repository on Github. There are a few reason's why I've started off with Git repository this time though:

1. There is a history of the additions and changes that have been made to my toolkit over time.
2. Github automatically provides a nice, friendly layout to view items in my toolkit.
3. I can use Git submodules to track open source projects without needing to keep a full (and quickly outdated) copy of these projects in my toolkit.
4. It's easy for others to view my toolkit, and even contribute to it (for example, by sending a pull request or lodging an issue), or even to fork it and adapt it to their own needs.
5. I can put absolutely any content in this repository - whatever works best for me - it could be an image, some markdown, a whole repository (as a submodule), or just a link - in all cases, Github tends to provide a nice friendly display for this content.

My toolkit is, in many ways, performing a similar function to blog post or 'liking' or 'starring' something, but I think that the semantics are important. Writing a post about something is all well and good, but it tends to get outdated, and buried amongst all the other things that I might blog about - it's too much work to trawl through a bunch of posts looking for one particular link. Similarly with starring something - just because I star it, it doesn't mean I use it - it just indicates that I find the project interesting and might follow up on it. My toolkit ONLY contains things that I have already found useful, or know that I'll need, and doesn't include any other extraneous material to get in the way when I need to find something. 

I've made a start by adding a bunch of submodules to projects that I could think of off the top of my head, but I'm already coming up with ideas for more. If you like the concept, head over to Github and [check it out](https://github.com/joshmcarthur/toolkit.git) - and feel free to contribute your favourite tools for me to try out!
