Last night I had a great opportuntity to talk about [Plain Language Law](https://plainlanguagelaw.nz), a site that I built using my own time and personal development time provided by [Ackama](https://ackama.com).

Plain Language Law is a site that turns New Zealand legislation into plain language using <abbr title="Large Language Models">LLMs</abbr>. This was the first meetup I'd presented at, so I really appreciated the invite, and the chance to do a bit of personal development with public speaking. I found I got a lot of value in conversations and questions, and I have some great ideas about ways I can build improvements into the data processing and QA pipeline.
