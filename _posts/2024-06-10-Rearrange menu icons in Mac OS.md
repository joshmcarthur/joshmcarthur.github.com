title: How to rearrange menu bar icons in Mac OS
---

This is a tip I re-discover every couple of years, then forget until I find my
menu bar getting a bit cluttered up again.

Holding down the Command key allows menu icons to be dragged backwards and
forwards along the menu bar to order them. This is available for all items other
than the control center and date/time, including system items like network,
bluetooth and sound.
