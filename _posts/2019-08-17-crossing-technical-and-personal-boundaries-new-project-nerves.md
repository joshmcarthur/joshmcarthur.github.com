A really interesting thought from Chris Toomey from Thoughtbot's 'The Bikeshed' podcast, that
really elegantly clarifies my own thinking on imposter syndrome, feelings of inadequacy, and the
strive to deliver value to a broad range of contexts.

(Paraphrased and left out a couple of less-relevant sentences for brevity that related to pairing at Thoughtbot)

I really like the statements made here. I think I personally tend to concentrate too much on what is
being brought to the table in technical skill, and not as much in the value that exists just from
having an expert(s) guiding an organisation through something that they're not necessarily
well-equpped to handle on theier own.
